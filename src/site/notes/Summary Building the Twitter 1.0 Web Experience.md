1. Twitter Lite; Progressive Web App; React
This article discusses the development of Twitter Lite, a Progressive Web App built with React that started in 2015. The project aimed to create a good experience for every type of device across the world. The application was designed to be fast, responsive, and accessible to users with low-end devices or unreliable network connections. This web-based approach allowed Twitter to build once and ship to everyone through a single codebase, providing regular updates and consistency across platforms for a better overall user experience.

2. 2017 launch; 75% more tweets; data saver
Twitter Lite, a Progressive Web App built with React, launched in 2017 and generated 75% more tweets than the previous mobile client. Starting in 2015, this project created a responsive experience for all devices worldwide, particularly benefiting users with low-end devices or unreliable connections. The PWA included data saver features to reduce mobile data usage while maintaining performance. This web-based approach allowed Twitter to maintain a single codebase, ensuring consistent experiences and regular updates across platforms while being fast, accessible, and cost-effective for users in emerging markets.

3. code splitting; VirtualScroller; service worker
Twitter Lite, launched in 2017, was a React-based Progressive Web App that generated 75% more tweets than its predecessor. The app employed code splitting to reduce initial load times, VirtualScroller to eliminate scrolling jank, and service worker technology for offline functionality. Its data saver mode and optimization techniques particularly benefited users in emerging markets with low-end devices or unreliable connections. The single codebase approach ensured consistent experiences across platforms while enabling fast performance, accessibility, and reduced data consumption through features like image compression and pre-caching, making the web experience universally responsive.

4. 10M push notifications; dark mode; accessibility
Twitter Lite, launched in 2017, was a React-based PWA delivering 10M push notifications daily with dark mode support and accessibility features. The app used code splitting, VirtualScroller for smooth scrolling, and service workers for offline functionality. Its data saver mode, image compression, and pre-caching benefited users with low-end devices or unreliable connections. This responsive design approach generated 75% more tweets than its predecessor while maintaining performance across all platforms. The single codebase enabled consistent experiences worldwide, ensuring fast performance on various devices through optimized loading techniques and reduced data consumption.

5. PRPL pattern; Build-Tracker; i18n pipeline
Twitter Lite, launched in 2017, implemented the PRPL pattern, Build-Tracker for performance budgeting, and optimized i18n pipeline alongside React. This PWA delivered 10M daily push notifications while supporting dark mode and accessibility features. Using code splitting, VirtualScroller, and service workers, it created responsive experiences across devices. Data saver mode and image compression reduced data usage for emerging markets, generating 75% more tweets than its predecessor. The single codebase approach enabled consistent experiences worldwide while maintaining performance through optimized loading techniques, making Twitter's web experience fast and accessible regardless of device or connection quality.

**Optimizing media and Images**
1. Progressive JPEGs; image optimization; 85% quality
This article discusses Progressive JPEGs and image optimization techniques implemented in Twitter Lite with 85% quality baseline. The document explores how Twitter enhanced image loading performance, especially on slow or expensive connections. Various strategies were employed to reduce image sizes without sacrificing visual quality, including capping image fidelity on high-resolution devices and implementing lazy loading to defer non-critical media loading. These optimizations significantly improved user experience by reducing data consumption and speeding up image rendering, particularly beneficial for users in regions with limited connectivity or those using lower-end devices.

2. Network Information API; PNG-8; 9.5% reduction
This article examines Progressive JPEGs and image optimization in Twitter Lite with 85% quality baseline, achieving a 9.5% reduction in canceled uploads through Network Information API and PNG-8 support. Twitter enhanced image loading by capping fidelity on high-resolution devices, saving one-third of data consumption with no visible quality loss. Strategies included lazy loading for non-critical media and on-device compression for user uploads, dynamically adjusting based on connection speed. These optimizations improved rendering performance from 18 frames to just one frame per image, significantly enhancing user experience in regions with limited connectivity.

3. 90x improvement; 150KB cap; adaptive bitrate
Progressive JPEGs in Twitter Lite delivered 90x improvement for users in India and Indonesia with 85% quality baseline, featuring 150KB caps on slow connections and adaptive bitrate streaming for videos. The Network Information API enabled dynamic image compression, achieving a 9.5% reduction in canceled uploads while preserving PNG-8 support for pixel artists. Twitter enhanced loading performance by capping fidelity on high-resolution devices, saving one-third of data with no visible quality loss. Image rendering improved from 18 frames to just one frame, significantly enhancing user experience in regions with limited connectivity.

4. pixel artists; 60fps scrolling; canvas resizing
Progressive JPEGs in Twitter Lite delivered 90x improvement in India and Indonesia with 85% quality, supporting pixel artists with lossless PNG-8 while targeting 60fps scrolling through canvas resizing and adaptive bitrate streaming. The Network Information API enabled dynamic compression with 150KB caps on 2G/3G connections, achieving 9.5% fewer canceled uploads. Image optimization techniques reduced rendering from 18 frames to one frame per image while saving one-third of data consumption on high-resolution devices with no visible quality loss, significantly enhancing user experience across all connection speeds.

5. 4MB to 500KB reduction; 16.667ms target; 256 colors
Progressive JPEGs in Twitter Lite achieved 4MB to 500KB reduction with 90x faster loading in India and Indonesia, maintaining 256 colors for pixel artists while targeting 16.667ms rendering (60fps scrolling). The 85% quality baseline with canvas resizing and adaptive bitrate streaming optimized media across all connections. Network Information API enabled dynamic compression with 150KB caps on slow networks, resulting in 9.5% fewer canceled uploads. These techniques improved image rendering from 18 frames to one frame while saving one-third of data on high-resolution devices without quality loss.
